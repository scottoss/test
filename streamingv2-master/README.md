# redbot restreamer cog

This is a plugin (aka "cog") for [Red DiscordBot v3](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/tree/V3/develop)

It provides the ability to play a stream from any streaming service supported by [streamlink](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink) in a discord voice channel.

Requirements:
* Red v3
* screen
* streamlink
* ffmpeg
* icecast

Note it's a bit of a hack and a bunch of these dependencies can be eliminated, but it's a good proof of concept and gets the job done.

Thanks to those in the Red discord server for helping me figure out how to extend Red quickly.
